# `TODO`
- [ ] wireframe skateboard
- [ ] create parameters
	- `food`: you lose when you reach -1.
	- `gold`: used to purchase supplies.
	- `day`: you win when you reach 30.
- [ ] create primary game modal with variable content
	- content will always be structured in this way:
		- text of event or encounter
		- one or more buttons that affect stats
- [ ] create a way to view party members and their stats
	- for now there will only be one part member
	- they will still be made with one javascript class or hook
